# As well as the .lando.yml and .lando.base.yml configuration files, you can
# also use .lando.local.yml for local personal changes. This file provides some
# examples that may be helpful depending on your system and usage.
# Copy one or merge multiple with custom changes into .lando.local.yml.
# Do note that if you are asking for debug help, including your .lando.local.yml
# is important.

# Example 1
# Remember some credentials on osx.
services:
  appserver:
    build_as_root:
      - curl http://github-media-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/osx/git-credential-osxkeychain -o git-credential-osxkeychain
      - mv git-credential-osxkeychain /usr/local/bin/
      - chmod u+x /usr/local/bin/git-credential-osxkeychain
      - git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain

# Example 2
# Use a custom php ini for some values. In this case, specifically for using
# lando on WSL with xdebug and your ide (ex PHPStorm) on Windows. You would
# need to update the IP address in php.ini as per /etc/resolv.conf on WSL.
# Use with a command like the below to set it correctly each time lando starts.
# z=`grep -E "[0-9.]{7,16}" /etc/resolv.conf -o` && sed -i "s/\b[0-9.]\{6,17\}\b/$z/" php.ini && lando start
services:
  appserver:
